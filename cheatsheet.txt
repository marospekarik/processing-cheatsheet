//1.Probability 

// 1.1 The probability of drawing a diamond is:

    number of diamonds / number of cards = 13 / 52 = 0.25 = 25%

// Calculate the probability of multiple events occurring in sequence.
    The probability of a coin turning up heads three times in a row is:

    (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8 (or 0.125)

// What is the probability of drawing two aces in a row from a deck of fifty-two cards?

    numberOfCards = 50
    numberOfAces = 2

    2/50 = 0.04 = 4%
    0.04 * 0.04 = 0.0016 = 1.6%


// 1.2 Choose random numbers from that array and generate events based on those choices.

    int[] stuff = new int[5]
    //[full] 1 is stored in the array twice, making it more likely to be picked.
    stuff[0] = 1;
    stuff[1] = 1;
    //[end]
    stuff[2] = 2;
    stuff[3] = 3;
    stuff[4] = 3;
    // Picking a random element from an array
    int index = int(random(stuff.length));

    // This will produce a 40% chance of printing the value 1, a 20% chance of printing 2, and a 40% chance of printing 3.
